# Plotly-challenge

Created a Flask app for building an interactive dashboard to explore the "Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet".

Created an interactive charts using Plotly.js

Various routes have been used to retreive data from SQLite database to create a Pie chart and Bubble chart for each sample.

Instructions:

Run app.py file. Flask API starter code to serve the data needed for your plots.
Once the file is running open a web browser and use http://127.0.0.1:5000/

A drop down box is populated with all the samples present in the database.
By default the first sample (940) is selected and the pie graph and bubble graph are based on the data for this sample.
